** How to setup the Emacs configuration file.
The emacs_conf.el file can be used without moving it away from the git repository. To do this, copy the init file to the emacs.d directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cp init.el ~/emacs.d/
#+END_SRC

The init file assumes that the joh-conf repository is placed in the home folder. 

** Update default packages
The default packages that Emacs will use are specified in the variable ~package-list~ found in ~emacs_conf.el~. If any new packages have been installed and are to be added to the default list, please follow these steps:

1. List all currently installed packages with: ~C-h v package-activated-list~

2. Copy the array to the ~package-list~ variable in ~emacs_conf.el~.

3. Restart emacs.
