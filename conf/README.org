** How to setup the Emacs configuration file.
The emacs_conf.el file can be used without moving it away from the git repository. To do this, copy the init file to the emacs.d directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cp init.el ~/emacs.d/
#+END_SRC

The init file assumes that the joh-conf repository is placed in the home folder.
