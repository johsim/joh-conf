* joh-conf

This project contains my preferred development setup for Ubuntu. The configuration is done with ansible,
to make the setup immutable.

** Setup
The configuration contains
- Emacs configuration
- Python3, pip, pyenv
- Terminator as preferred terminal
- oh-my-zsh
- cronjob running the ansible configuration
- fzf for history search, cd and jumping feature
- Global gitconfig and gitignore

Also, a number of tools that can be useful:
- docker
- tiny-care-terminal
- httpie
- tig
- chromium
- etc

Most configuration files are symlinked, to ensure that all changes will be captured in source control.

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cd ~/
$ git clone https://github.com/johsim/joh-conf.git
$ ./installation.sh
#+END_SRC

The shell script will install ansible and then run an ansible playbook for the rest of the setup.
The repo can currently only be cloned to the home directory.

** SSMTP
To setup a ssmtp server, please run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cd ~/joh-conf/ansible
$ ansible-playbook email-configuration.yaml --ask-become-pass
#+END_SRC

Please use a throw-away email without 2-factor authentication, as 2-factor won't work with ssmtp.

* Development
To test the setup (for a clean environment), docker can be used:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cd ~/joh-conf/
$ docker build -t ubuntutest:xenial .
$ docker run -id -v $(pwd):/home/test/joh-conf --name ubtest ubuntutest:xenial
$ docker exec -it ubtest /bin/bash
#+END_SRC
