* joh-conf

This project contains my preferred development setup for Ubuntu. The repository is arranged as follows:

 * _docs_: Tips and tricks that I have accumulated while working.
 * _conf_: Settings-files for my preferred configuration. See the local README for more info.
 * _templates_: Outline for scripts with comments on stuff that I might find useful in the future.

Cheers,
johsim
